      <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web)
         or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing<br>
         a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, 
         and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly<br> 
         refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
         client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and 
         e-commerce development. </p>
